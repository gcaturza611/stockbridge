                                Last September 19-23, 2020, the school celebrated Literacy Week. Stockbridge community did varied activities that showcased the creativity, 
                                talents, and skills in writing and speaking of the Stockbridge kids. Each grade level was given a task to finish within the day. The students 
                                showed enthusiasm and excitement throughout the celebration. Each of them took PRIDE in completing their outputs. The event culminated by 
                                awarding the students who excelled among the rest. Here are the students who bagged first place in each contest. Zach Andre Chua for Scan and 
                                Predict Competition Grade 1 Category and Youssef Al Shuaibi for Grade 2 Category. Huey Marco Gascon for Creative Cover Design Contest for 
                                Grade 3 Category. Wayne Fontanilla and Angeli Ysabelle Pagente for Electronic Story Writing Contest Grade 4 Category and Henrich 
                                Miguel Gascon and Pierce Stephen Lagamayo for Grade 5 Category. Kim Lian Cabote for Extemporaneous Speech Contest for Grade 6 Category. 
                                The event successfully promoted an understanding and awareness of the importance of reading, speaking, and writing as an integral form of 
                                communication. The online platform or learning modality may be new to all of us especially to our students but learning behind the screen 
                                does not stop them to value knowledge and literacy.

                                August is known as the National Language Month or the Buwan ng Wika. Stockbridge celebrated Buwan ng Wika with the theme "Wika ng Kasaysayan, 
                                Kasaysayan ng Wika" virtually from August 24 to 27, 2020. The event was filled with arts, crafts, quiz bee, and virtual games about Philippine 
                                history, cultures, and beliefs are few of the fun activities we had during the week-long celebration. It was indeed full of knowledge and fun 
                                at the same time. Buwan ng Wika is a time to remind the public of the importance of the Filipino language. Our country’s language shows how rich 
                                and unique our culture and heritage. Our language bridges different communities and strengthens us as a Filipino.

                                SAIS conducted an outreach program at St. Vincent Strambi Home for the Aged last November 18, 2020. 
                                The school handed-over the packed relief goods and parol with messages from the SAIS students to the home for the aged. 
                                This simple act of showing them that they are remembered made them feel loved. 
                                Seeing their genuine smiles and tearful eyes due to so much joy and happiness is the pure indication that despite these challenging times, 
                                we can still be the reason for someone ’ s joy. It is a great manifestation of the true spirit of Christmas which is to spread generosity, love, 
                                and care. Let us be the reason to bring light in someone’s darkness. Spread love, spread happiness!

                                Christmas Lighting is an annual celebration of the JIB schools. It served as an opening program as we welcome the Christmas season. 
                                The Stockbridge community lighted up a Christmas tree last November 23, 2020 as a symbol of life, camaraderie, and reminds us of 
                                the spirit of Christmas. This season, we celebrated the Christmas Lighting through virtual activity. It was a different setup but 
                                the same Christmas spirit. Because of the COVID 19 pandemic, things got different in terms of how we celebrate different events and activities. 
                                It taught us to be strong and courageous to face different challenges in life, and to be adaptive and considerate at the same time. 
                                As we celebrated the Christmas Lighting event, we lit up the hearts of the community as we, together, lit our Christmas trees and lights at home. 
                                Students were asked to make arts and crafts during their MAPEH time. On the day of the event, students, teachers, guests lit up their 
                                own lights through their stars, Christmas trees, Christmas lights, parols, and even a simple light inside their room.

                                The weeklong celebration was a collaboration of both Gensan and Davao schools. The students actively enjoyed the different activities 
                                that were lined up for them such as Integrity pot craft making and Tagxedo. Crafts and arts excite Stockbridge kids during the first 
                                and second days of the week. On the third day, the school prepared a nobility webinar with the theme “Developing Young Global Leaders: 
                                A Career Forum.” The said webinar became more interesting for the students because of the presence of the invited speakers – 
                                Mr. Jesse Tan, Dr. Adora Auguis, Ms. Louvy Gal, and Mr. Ricardo Pascua Jr. These speakers shared their backgrounds, professions, 
                                and how noble their jobs are to inspire our Stockbridge kids to share their helping hands and services to the family and community. 
                                Our Gensan students also had a chance to meet Davao students on the fourth day. And the last day of celebration was intended for 
                                the leadership forum entitled “Unleashing the Leader in Me: A Leadership Forum.” Prominent and famous names in the business industry 
                                such as Ms. Maryelle Bergavera, Dr. Deanne Corrine Tabar, the CEO of the NCCC Malls, Mr. Lafayette Tan, and the chairperson of the 
                                Joji Ilagan Schools herself, Ms. Joji Bian. These business leaders were able to impart knowledge, techniques, strategies, and skills 
                                on how to be effective global leaders.

                                Stockbridge celebrated Literacy Week last September 23-27, 2019. Its goal is to highlight the value of literacy among the students in 
                                various activities. Teachers invited mystery readers each day to read to the students a story for 15-20 minutes. Students engaged in 
                                book exchange where they could bring books they no longer need. They brought many books but only took one book of their choice. 
                                The books which are collected were turn-over during the outreach program. There was also an Essay Writing Competition where students 
                                from Grades 3-5 participated. On the other hand, students from Kinder to Grade 3 play a part in the storytelling. Aside from those 
                                activities, they also performed role-playing adapted from a short story of their choice.

                                Stockbridge American International School had its Christmas Show with the theme “12 Gifts of Christmas” last December 11, 2019, 
                                at the Abreeza Ayala Mall Event Center, Davao City. The event showcased the students' talents as they presented on stage with 
                                their colorful costumes and performance. The Christmas show centered on a girl named Emma played by a kinder student who was 
                                sleeping when she suddenly heard a sound and later found out it was Santa. She wants to make sure it was him, so she got up and checked. 
                                To her surprise, she saw partridges in pear trees and turtledoves! She tried to go back to sleep because she was not convinced and 
                                thinking everything is just a dream, another form of gift visited her. They were French hens! The rest of the 12 gifts visited her too. 
                                It consisted of calling birds, golden rings, geese, swans, milkmaids, ladies dancing, lords leaping, pipers piping, and drummers which 
                                were all played by the different grade levels. After Emma has witnessed all of them, she was amazed and asked herself, were they real? 
                                Are they really from Santa? Then Santa showed herself to Emma telling her that she deserved to be amazed by all that she has seen 
                                because she was not on the naughty list. After that, she went back to sleep knowing that her kindness has rewarded.

                                Last November 20, 2020, the school celebrated Christmas Star Lighting virtually. The event is filled with fun and memorable activities that 
                                involved everyone to welcome the Christmas season and to give light to the world despite of difficulties we are currently facing due to pandemic. 
                                Students strengthened the bond of togetherness and love as they created crafts for the symbols of Christmas. They even shared about what those 
                                symbols represented. To share their personal experiences as they welcome the spirit of Christmas, kids prepared a video on how they are going to 
                                celebrate joyfully by sharing with us what is Christmas to them. To make the celebration more special, teachers participated as they composed 
                                this years’ Christmas community song entitled “Thank you for the love.” The highlight of the celebration was the launching of the donation drive 
                                that aims to extend help to our community. Indeed, unity and love makes Stockbridge the light of Christmas.

                                Giving back to the community can help people feel more at peace with the world knowing they have done their part in fulfilling the mission 
                                of helping others. SAIS curriculum does not only aim to develop the intellectual aspect but also the social responsibility of the students. 
                                With the current situation that we are all in now such as these pandemic and super strong typhoon that caused flooding and other disastrous 
                                effects, the call to help is essential. During the Christmas Star Lighting activity, the school announced the launching of our Outreach Program 
                                that aims to extend our services to our community. It is called "Stockbridge Helping Hands, Stronger Together". Many generous #StockbridgeFamilies 
                                supported the cause. They were able to fulfill the mission of extending services to the community because of the parents and family. 
                                All the donations were turned-over to the Philippine Air Force-TOG 11 as partner because of their specialization in providing air transportation 
                                for relief goods and other essential items. Helping hands are an integral part of it all and the mission continues!
