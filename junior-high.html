            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <h2>Kinder to Grades 1-10 Programs</h2>
                <p>
                    Stockbridge American International School provides students with the best educational opportunities for them to become Global Business Leaders.
                    <br><br>
                    Our students come from countries around the world and bring with them their own cultural experiences that are openly shared with their classmates. 
                    The international mindset means that students see past nationalities and see one another as fellow students and global collaborators.
                    <br><br>
                    At the center of everything that we do are our CORE values. Our CORE values include Leadership, Integrity, Open-mindedness, Nobility, and Stewardship or LIONS. 
                    These provide the guiding lights for everything we do inside the classroom, within our school walls, in our homes, in our communities, and throughout the world. 
                    These CORE values emphasize the essential and enduring components required to ensure achievement as a Global Leader and Lifelong Learner. 
                    Our CORE values will develop into what every graduate of Stockbridge American International School will be known for : the Stockbridge Advantage : 
                    Graduate Attributes (SAGA).
                </p>

                <div class="img-logo">
                    <img src="assets/images/dare-to-lead-elementary-no-bg.png" alt="">
                </div>
                
                <p>
                    Our SAGA and the expansion of our global awareness leads us to the Stockbridge American International School academic curriculum. 
                    While we are board certified from the Department of Education here in the Philippines, we integrate various international curricula 
                    depending on your child’s academic program.
                    <br><br>
                    In our elementary school, we integrate the NACEL International School Systems Standards (USA). Therefore, we have a stronger presence of 
                    the foundations of the English language and the integration of media arts. The benefit of our integration of international curricula means 
                    that when your child completes an academic milestone, they will receive two certificates; one from the Department of Education and one 
                    from our US International educational partner.
                    <br><br>
                    Stockbridge American International School stands apart in our focus on Entrepreneurship. Two of our core subjects, Entrepreneurship and Innovations (EAI) 
                    and Leadership and Personality Development (LEAP), guide our students in learning how to be a global leader and a noble entrepreneur. 
                    Some outcomes from these two classes include researching and analyzing market trends, developing their own business plan, 
                    preparing for a successful job interview, and learning how to facilitate a Zoom meeting.
                    <br><br>
                    Stockbridge celebrates who we are throughout every academic year. However, our internationalization takes center focus during our yearly 
                    International Week celebrations. These celebrations take who we are and integrate the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals to further 
                    expand our global awareness and presence.

                                The kindergarten program marks a child’s entry into formal education. Stockbridge offers a high-quality kindergarten program with a strong core 
                                curriculum. Kindergarten students will learn Science, English Language Arts, Leadership and Personality Development, Math, and take part in an 
                                Individualized Reading Program. Children also develop strong social skills, independence, confidence, and a love for learning. 
                                As students connect their classroom learning with life skills, their achievements are being assessed and recorded in our LIONS PRIDE, 
                                our kindergarten badge book. This book will serve as a permanent record of skills learned in kindergarten. By the end of the program, 
                                students become confident learners, readers and writers, and ready for Grade 1.

                                In this class, students are taught how to be entrepreneurs and business leaders. They learn how to research and analyze market trends, 
                                create their own business plan, and then bring their plan into fruition during our Market Day event. The development of their leadership 
                                skills will be expanded upon in the Stockbridge original subject class of Leadership and Personality Development.
