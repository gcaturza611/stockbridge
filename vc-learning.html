                    In light of the global pandemic, Stockbridge developed a Flexible Learning Program in response to the challenge of providing continuity of learning 
                    and enhanced learning modalities to our young learners most especially at this time.
                    <br><br>
                    The Stockbridge Flexible Learning Program is an innovative approach to learning that addresses our current social environment. 
                    It is informed by extensive research on best practices from both the local and international community. 
                    It is also based on the Department of Education’s Flexible Delivery Options (D.O. 21 s. 2019) and Learning Continuity Plan. 
                    The program is further enhanced and complemented by learning frameworks of our international education partners, the Fieldwork Education (UK) 
                    and the Nacel International School Systems (NISS, Minnesota and USA).

                            <p>
                                The Stockbridge curriculum is built into the framework of our international education partners 
                                (Fieldwork, UK; NACEL International School Systems, USA) which provides breadth and depth to student learning. 
                                School leaders, teachers and students have access to a global network of support resources.

                                Students learn with classmates through both online and offline activities. Live and online classes are done to foster 
                                collaborative learning and independent home-based activities with or without parents’ guidance are given to reinforce learning. 
                                This is to consider parent’s schedule, multi-child household and availability of connectivity.
                            </p>

                                Students get excited for each session. Different learning experiences are used according to session outcomes and learners’ needs. 
                                This includes but not limited to big group classes, small focused group meetings and personalized one-on-one learning. 
                                Exciting activities to strengthen student learning is also used such as gamification of learning, virtual tours and learning 
                                activities using different applications.

                                Each class session is carefully planned out to make sure that learners meet their goals for the week. 
                                Lessons are delivered in chunks or modules and are seamlessly integrated to develop a deep understanding of different concepts across subject areas. 
                                Assessment is flexible and processed focused rather than product/output-focused.

                                Being a part of the exclusive network of the JIB International Schools, all teachers have undergone training sessions and workshops

                                Students become global citizens. We bring the world to our virtual classrooms. Through our international partners and our World Education 
                                Advisory Council, students get diverse experiences and exchanges. Students get to make friends with other international students around 
                                the world through web-based learning platforms and as well as virtual field trips. This fosters multiculturalism and internationalism.
